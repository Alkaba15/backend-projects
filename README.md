# backend-projects
This repository contains all my backend projects built while learning and mastering modern web development.  
I focus on building **clean, scalable APIs** using different databases and architectures.

## 🚀 Current Focus
🟢 **Node.js + Express + MongoDB**  
Building RESTful APIs, managing authentication, and learning production-ready backend design.

## 🧭 Future Goals
In the future, I’ll extend this repository to include:
- PostgreSQL (with Prisma or Sequelize)
- Redis (for caching)
- WebSocket (for real-time communication)
- Microservices architecture
- Cloud deployment (AWS / Docker)

## 💡 Vision
This repository is my personal backend portfolio — a place to experiment, learn, and showcase my progress as a backend developer.
